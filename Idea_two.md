# üß† Recession Prediction Model Using Economic Indicators (Supervised ML)

## Overview

A Recession Prediction Model using publicly available economic data is highly relevant and marketable in today‚Äôs rapidly shifting economic landscape. It leverages supervised machine learning to forecast recessions using lagged macroeconomic indicators, helping businesses, investors, and policymakers stay one step ahead.

---

## üî• Why It‚Äôs Marketable:

- **Economic Uncertainty**: Inflation, interest rates, and global supply chain disruptions have created volatile conditions, increasing demand for predictive insights.  
- **Risk Management**: Companies and investors want to anticipate downturns to adjust budgets, hiring, and investments proactively.  
- **Policy Decision-Making**: Governments can use recession predictions to time stimulus programs or interest rate changes.

---

## üéØ Target Audience:

- Financial analysts, hedge funds, and investment firms  
- Corporate strategy teams and CFOs  
- Public policymakers and economists  
- Business intelligence and risk teams at large companies  

---

## üí° How It Would Work:

**Input Features:**
- GDP growth rate  
- Unemployment rate  
- Interest rate (Fed funds rate)  
- Inflation rate (CPI)  
- Yield curve spread (10-year minus 2-year Treasury yield)  
- Consumer sentiment and confidence indices  
- Industrial production, housing starts, PMI, etc.  
*(with time lags engineered into the features)*

**Target:**
- Binary classification: Is the U.S. in a recession (1) or not (0) in the next quarter?  
- Labeled using NBER official recession dates

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Series Component

While this is a supervised machine learning project (not pure time-series forecasting), **time series plays an essential role** in the way data is prepared, split, and interpreted.

### Required Time-Based Features:
- **Lag Engineering**: Economic signals affect recessions with a delay. GDP from 2 quarters ago or yield curve from last year may be highly predictive.
- **Rolling Averages**: Smooth volatility in metrics like CPI or unemployment to better reflect trends.
- **Chronological Train/Test Split**: To avoid data leakage, the model is trained on earlier periods and tested on future periods (e.g. 1970‚Äì2010 train, 2011‚Äì2023 test).

### Optional Advanced Techniques:
- **LSTM/GRU (Deep Learning)**: Model long-term sequential patterns directly.
- **ARIMA/Prophet**: Forecast individual economic indicators before feeding them into classification.
- **Sliding Windows**: Construct samples using a moving window to capture dynamic temporal patterns.

This hybrid approach allows for **interpretable predictive modeling** while incorporating **temporality and economic cycles** effectively.
